I am developing a Python-based STAR SHIP simulation project with a Tkinter GUI for a single computer, based on "The Complete STAR SHIP: A Simulation Project." I need a helm module to handle ship maneuvers and evasive tactics. The module should:
- Execute maneuvers (e.g., turn, accelerate) based on operator commands.
- Implement basic evasive tactics during combat (e.g., random direction changes).
- Update ship status in a common_data dictionary.
- Display helm data in the GUI (e.g., speed, direction).

Please provide:
- A design outline for the helm logic.
- A sample Python implementation with random tactics and Tkinter display.
- Suggestions for syncing with combat events.
- A test plan to verify maneuvers and tactics.

Assume integration with a simulation controller.
