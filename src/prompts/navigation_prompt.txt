I am developing a Python-based STAR SHIP simulation project with a Tkinter GUI for a single computer, inspired by "The Complete STAR SHIP: A Simulation Project." I need a navigation module to manage ship course plotting and interaction with celestial objects. The module should:
- Plot courses based on operator commands (e.g., "set course to sector X").
- Track celestial objects (e.g., array of 20 objects with positions).
- Update ship position in a common_data dictionary.
- Display navigation data in the GUI (e.g., text labels or simple map).

Please provide:
- A design outline for the navigation logic.
- A sample Python implementation using random data for celestial objects and Tkinter for display.
- Suggestions for optimizing array sizes and real-time updates.
- A test plan to verify course plotting and object tracking.

Assume integration with a simulation controller.
