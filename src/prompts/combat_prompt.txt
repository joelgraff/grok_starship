I am developing a Python-based STAR SHIP simulation project with a Tkinter GUI for a single computer, based on "The Complete STAR SHIP: A Simulation Project." I need a combat/damage system module to simulate weapon effects and damage distribution. The module should:
- Handle weapons (e.g., phasers, photon torpedoes) with random damage effects.
- Distribute damage across ship systems and crew health (via common_data).
- Update combat status and display results in the GUI (e.g., damage reports).
- Prepare for integration with helm and engineering modules.

Please provide:
- A design outline for the combat logic.
- A sample Python implementation using random numbers and Tkinter display.
- Suggestions for realistic damage tuning.
- A test plan to verify weapon effects and damage distribution.

Assume integration with a simulation controller.
