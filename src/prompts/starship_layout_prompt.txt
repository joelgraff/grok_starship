I am developing a Python-based STAR SHIP simulation project for a single computer with a Tkinter GUI, based on "The Complete STAR SHIP: A Simulation Project." I need a module for managing crew movements across the starship, building on an existing deck layout generation module. The crew movement module should:
- Use the deck layout data (e.g., graph of rooms and corridors) to determine valid movement paths.
- Support random daily activities (e.g., moving to lounge or quarters) and command-assigned tasks (e.g., "go to engineering").
- Include basic movement logic (e.g., step-by-step pathfinding or random walks).
- Prepare for integration with a future crew simulation module tracking health and fatigue.

Please provide:
- A design outline for the movement logic.
- A sample Python implementation using the deck layout data, with optional pathfinding (e.g., A* algorithm).
- Suggestions for real-time performance optimization on a single computer.
- A test plan to verify crew movements.

Iâ€™m already developing this, so please refine or expand on my current work.
