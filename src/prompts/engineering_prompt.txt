I am developing a Python-based STAR SHIP simulation project with a Tkinter GUI for a single computer, inspired by "The Complete STAR SHIP: A Simulation Project." I need an engineering module to track and manage ship systems. The module should:
- Monitor systems (e.g., energy, shields, propulsion) with adjustable status (0-100).
- Respond to crew tasks (e.g., repair shields) from the crew simulation.
- Update system status in a common_data dictionary.
- Display engineering data in the GUI (e.g., progress bars).

Please provide:
- A design outline for the engineering logic.
- A sample Python implementation with system updates and Tkinter display.
- Suggestions for integrating with crew and combat modules.
- A test plan to verify system management.

Assume integration with a simulation controller.
